Value Prop Canvas
-----------------

Problem:
Non-technical AI agent creators lack sustainable monetization options beyond token launches, exposing them to extreme market fluctuations and revenue instability.

Jobs-to-be-done:
- When building an AI agent, I want to monetize it without relying on a token launch, so I can generate a stable revenue stream and focus on improving my agent.
- When deploying an AI agent, I want simple monetization options that don't require technical skills, so I can focus on growth.
- When scaling my AI agent, I want a revenue model that aligns with how users naturally interact with my agent, so I can maximize earnings without forcing artificial engagement.

Pains:
- Revenue volatility causes unstable earnings, making it difficult for AI agent creators to sustain their work long-term.
- Limited monetization paths force AI agent creators to rely on token launches and trading fees, making their income highly speculative.
- High technical barriers prevent non-technical AI agent creators from implementing alternative monetization models, limiting their ability to generate direct revenue.
